        <br>
        If you need to meet with a specific faculty member, please check their individual office hours or contact them directly via email to arrange an appointment.</li>
        <li> ------ </li>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> Q: What kind of computer should incoming freshmen purchase?</li>
        <li>Incoming freshmen do not need to purchase a personal computer, as the department provides access to well-equipped computing labs with the latest hardware and software. However, if you choose to bring your own device, any entry-level Windows or Mac computer will be sufficient for most academic tasks.
        <br>
        For students who prefer to use their own computers, we recommend a Windows or Mac system with the following minimum specifications:
        <ul>
            <li>Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent</li>
            <li>RAM: 8 GB (16 GB recommended)</li>
            <li>Storage: 256 GB SSD (512 GB recommended)</li>
            <li>Operating System: Windows 10/11 or macOS Monterey or later</li>
            <li>Graphics: Integrated graphics are generally sufficient for most coursework</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Chromebooks are not recommended at this time due to potential compatibility issues with some required software applications. However, as the department increasingly adopts cloud-based tools, Chromebooks may become a more viable option in the future.
        <br>
        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Students are strongly encouraged to utilize the department's computing labs, which are equipped with up-to-date technology and software. This ensures consistent access to course-specific tools and a standardized computing environment. The department will notify students of any updates to recommended computer specifications as needed.</li>
        <li> ------ </li>

        Before submitting any forms, be sure to meet with your advisor to discuss your academic plans and ensure you meet all requirements.</li>
        <li> ------ </li>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> How do I appeal a grade or academic decision?</li>
        <li>If you wish to appeal a grade or academic decision, you should first discuss the matter with your instructor. If the issue remains unresolved, contact your academic advisor and the Undergraduate Program Coordinator, Dr. Joseph Shelton. They will guide you through your options and help determine the appropriate next steps.
<br>
After consulting with your advisor and Dr. Shelton, you may contact the Department Chair to further discuss the issue. If a resolution is still not reached, you may proceed with the formal grade appeal process as outlined in the university’s academic policies. This typically involves submitting a written appeal along with supporting documentation.</li>
        <li> ------ </li>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> What should I do if I am considering changing my major?</li>
        <li>A: If you are considering changing your major, it is important to first discuss your options with your current academic advisor. They can help you understand the academic and career implications of the change—especially how it may affect your degree progress and future job opportunities. Many students change majors without fully considering how it aligns with their long-term goals.
        <br>
        Changing your major more than once is strongly discouraged, as it often results in delayed graduation and unnecessary coursework.
        <br>
        If you decide to move forward, you must complete the <a href="https://www.vsu.edu/files/docs/register-classes/change-of-major-concentration-form.pdf">Change of Major/Concentration Form</a> and submit it to your academic advisor for processing.</li>
        <li> ------ </li>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> How can I find out about internship or job opportunities in Computer Science?</li>
        <li> A: The Computer Science Department regularly shares internship and job opportunities via VSU student email and the departmental Slack channel. Students are strongly encouraged to check both frequently, as time-sensitive announcements and important updates are often posted through these platforms.
        <br>
        Additionally, VSU’s Career Services Office offers valuable support, including access to internships, job fairs, resume workshops, and networking events. Faculty members may also have industry connections and can provide personalized guidance or referrals to help you explore internship and job opportunities in the field.
        <br>
        Be cautious of internship scams, especially those received via email or text message that promise unusually high pay (e.g., several hundred dollars per week) for minimal remote work. These are often fraudulent. If you receive a suspicious message or are unsure about the legitimacy of an opportunity, consult your academic advisor or the Career Services Office before responding or sharing any personal information.</li>
        <li> ------ </li>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong>Where do I get my alternate PIN for registration?</li>
        <li>You must contact your academic advisor to obtain your alternate PIN. During this advising session, your advisor will review your degree progress and provide a recommended list of courses for the upcoming semester along with the PIN.
        <br>
        Please note that advisors are not permitted to release PINs without first meeting or communicating with you. This policy ensures that students enroll in courses that align with their degree requirements.
        <br>
        The Department Chair cannot share alternate PINs, as the chair-person does not have access to the specific course planning details for individual students. Only your assigned advisor can provide the necessary academic guidance and registration approval.
        <br>
        If you choose to register for courses that were not recommended by your advisor, you will be responsible for any delays in graduation or credits that do not count toward your degree.</li>
        <li> ------ </li>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> What should I do if I have questions about financial aid or scholarships?</li>
        <li>A: For questions related to financial aid, please contact the Financial Aid Office at VSU. They can provide guidance on available aid options, eligibility requirements, and application procedures.
        <br>
        Regarding scholarships, please note that the Department of Computer Science does not award scholarships directly to students. Scholarships are administered by the University and are typically granted at the time of admission.
        <br>
        Students may explore external scholarship opportunities, such as those offered by the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF). However, it is important to be cautious of scholarship scams. Avoid any opportunities that require payment or request sensitive personal information.
        <br>
        If you are unsure about the legitimacy of an external scholarship, contact your academic advisor for guidance before applying. They can help you verify the opportunity and ensure it is reputable.</li>
        </li>
        <li> ------ </li>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> What should I do if I need to withdraw from a course?</li>
        <li>A: If you need to withdraw from a course, you should first discuss your situation with your academic advisor. They can help you understand the implications of withdrawing, including how it may affect your academic standing and financial aid. If you decide to proceed, you will need to complete the official course withdrawal form and submit it to your advisor before the specified deadline.</li>
