    <h1>Computer Science Department - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

    <h2>General Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> What programs does the Computer Science Department offer?</li>
        <li>A: The Department of Computer Science at VSU offers undergraduate and graduate programs, including Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Master of Science in Computer Science.</li>
        <li> ------ </li>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> How can I contact the Department of Computer Science?</li>
        <li>A: You can contact the department by email at <a href="mailto:computerscience@vsu.edu">computerscience@vsu.edu</a> or by phone at 804-524-5969.</li>
       <li> ------ </li>        
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> What are the office hours of the Department of Computer Science?</li>
        <li>A: The office hours for the Department of Computer Science vary for each faculty member. Generally, each fulltime faculty member holds regular office hours for a total of 6 hours per week, providing ample opportunities for students to seek assistance or engage in discussions. Additionally, fulltime faculty members are available for an extra two hours per week by appointment to accommodate individual needs.

        To find specific information about the office hours for each faculty member, you can visit <a href="http://joonlee.org/OfficeHours.html">http://joonlee.org/OfficeHours.html</a>.</li>
        <li> ------ </li>
        <li style="color:darkgreen;"><strong>Q:</strong> What kind of computers should the incomming freshman students need to buy?</li>
        <li>A: For incoming freshman students, any entry-level computer, whether Windows or Mac, should be sufficient for most academic tasks. It is important to note that owning a personal computer is not a requirement, as the department provides several computing labs with the latest computers for student use.
<br><br>
While both Windows and Mac systems are suitable, Chromebooks are currently less recommended due to potential limitations in running certain software applications. However, as the department continues to adopt more cloud-based tools, Chromebooks may become a viable option in the future.
<br><br>
We highly encourage students to take advantage of the department's computing labs, which are equipped with up-to-date technology. This not only ensures access to the necessary software but also provides a standardized environment for academic work. As the curriculum evolves and technology advances, the department will keep students informed about any specific requirements or changes regarding recommended computer specifications.</li>
