        <p><strong>Joon-Suk Lee</strong>  is Professor and Chair of the Department of Computer Science at Virginia State University.<br><br>
        His scholarship spans Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), and the design of technology-augmented coordinated systems. In recent years, Dr. Lee’s work has expanded to include artificial intelligence education, responsible AI integration, and the development of scalable AI literacy frameworks for higher education and community settings. He leads statewide and multi-institutional initiatives that develop openly licensed AI curricula, generative-AI–enhanced instructional materials, and accessible AI learning platforms designed for institutions with limited computing resources.<br><br>
        Before entering academia, Dr. Lee served as a research scientist and senior software engineer in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries. His work included developing laser-marking systems and factory-automation processing units, as well as building wireless network protocols and applications for large-scale telecommunication infrastructures. This industry background informs his applied approach to AI education, emphasizing real-world relevance, interdisciplinary integration, and workforce alignment.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Lee received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Brown University, and a B.S. in Computer Science from Pace University.
